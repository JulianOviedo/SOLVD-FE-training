# Solvd Front-end mentoring 2024

This repository contains all information about the lectures and serves as a central repository to submit all your class works.

## Structure

You need to create a folder in the `homeworks` folder. The name should be `firstName-lastName`. E.g. for a developer Julian Oviedo the name would be `julian-oviedo`. The Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.

## Pull Requests

### Naming

Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for a developer Julian Oviedo prefix would be `jo-01-html`. In case of prefix collisions in the future the common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: `jovi-01-html`.

### Reviews

Once PR is created you have to do the following things:

- Assign your mentor as a reviewer
- Ping the mentor about the PR ;)
